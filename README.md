# 18bits_-processor  
2019-2020 Fall CSE3015 - Digital Logic Project

In this project, we are supposed to design a basic processor which has the 18 bits
address width, again 18 bits data width, 16 registers and supports 16 instructions:  
ADD, AND, OR, XOR, ADDI, ANDI, ORI, XORI, LD, ST, JUMP, BEQ, BLT, BGT,
BLE, BGE.

For first step, a ISA table is designed and based on that table, a java program that convert instructions to binary messages, is implemented

For second step, a 18 bits-processor is designed with it's components like Arithmetic Logic Unit, Branch Unit, Program Counter, Register File, Control Unit, Adders, Comparators and finally Main Unit in Logisim tool. 

Project manual and a detailed report are also included on reports folder.
